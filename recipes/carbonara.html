    <img src="/home/nickvm/Documents/odin-recipes/images/carbonara.jpeg"/>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Classic Carbonara dish is truly delightful, however I can never cook it right.</p>
<p>The issue is that I mix the eggs too much and it becomes scambled eggs pasta more so than actual Carbonara.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

    <li>Pasta of Choice</li>
    <li>6 Eggs</li>
    <li>The fatty pork<li</>
    <li>Parmesan</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>

<li>Cook the pasta <em>al dente</em></li>
<li>Throw your pork in a frying pan(no oil or butter is needed as it has plenty of fat) and cook until crispy</li>
<li>Prepare you egg mix by separating 4 yolks and adding 2 whole eggs, then mix in some shredded parmesan cheese</li>
<li>bla bla bla</li>
<li>Like I said earlier, I don`t even know how to make it myself</li>
<li>Hopefully you got a better result than me</li>

</ol>
